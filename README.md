# I Told You it Was Private

When you, beloved library author, remove private methods, praise and glory should
come in hordes for gardening your code with such dedication and pursuit of
pristine end-user interfaces and overall library perfection.

What you face instead is hordes of complaints because some frickin lazy people
call themselves rebels, resist any kind of authority, and have access to the
source code, so to the hell with the contract, they say.

Enough diplomacy, the time for punishment has arrived! This library will put
those losers in their place:

    class Awesome
      i_told_you_it_was_private :gone_method
    end

And contemplate your **revenge**.
